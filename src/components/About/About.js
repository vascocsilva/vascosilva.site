        Born and raised in the beautiful city of Viana do Castelo, Portugal, I studied and graduated in what is commonly known in southern Europe as "Informatics Engineering", at Universidade do Minho, Braga.

        I love web development and design, to learn new programming technologies and languages.<br />
      I'm starting to believe that javascript is "the language to rule them all" but, I don't run away from some php, c, kotlin, java...
      </p>

        I am currently working as a software developer at <a href="www.gen.pt">gen design studio</a>.

        I'm very passionate about photography, and I love to wander the streets, looking for stories, for the perfect light and framing, to capture the "decisive moment", or just and ordinary moment that I felt compelled to.
        I often use my strobes to get some visions and images I have in my mind, and to portray people the best I can.
        I'm also very enthusiastic on doing analog photography, and my cameras' shelf always has some more space to another analog camera.
